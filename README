NAME
    Jifty::Plugin::SiteNews - Provide site news in your app

DESCRIPTION
    Provides a way to include site news in your Jifty app. To use it, you
    will need to add a news model:

      package YourApp::Model::News;
      use Jifty::DBI::Schema;
      use YourApp::Record schema {
        # ..additional properties go here, like 'author'
      };
      use Jifty::Plugin::SiteNews::Mixin::Model::News;

    You will also need to alias the view somewhere; from YourApp::View:

      require Jifty::Plugin::SiteNews::View::News;
      alias Jifty::Plugin::SiteNews::View::News under '/news';
